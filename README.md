KnightsTravails
===============

A small programming challenge
------------------------------------------

This program calculates the shortest path travelled by a knight moving between
any two squares on a chessboard. Input/output is in the form of chess square
codes:

$java com.company.Main A8 B7
C7 B5 D6 B7


------------------------------------------
Compilation and running instructions:
Windows:
Compile with make_windows.bat
Run with run_windows.bat
By default, the run script will use the sample input shown above. To provide
your own input, launch the run script from the command line with your input as
arguments to the script (exactly as though you were launching the java program 
from the command line). Eg: $run_windows.bat C5 D8

Linux:
Compile with make_linux.sh
Run with run_linux.sh
The run script will prompt for input which will be used to execute the program.
